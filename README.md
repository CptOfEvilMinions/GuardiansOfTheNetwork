## Week 1 - Intro to Incident Response(IR)
This week we are using DVWA for our incident response demo. DVWA provides a broken webapp that is ready to be hacked out of the box. Docker was platform of choice because if a container becomes corrupted just restart it :).

## Week 2 - Intro to IR playbooks
Last week we had a review of last week's demo and a discussion on lessons learned from the incident. Next, we had a discussion on how to make a playbook for a compromised account. For this week's demo we will be using Threatconnect, a threat intel platform, to create automated playbooks. These automated playbooks will take in some type of information such as a domain or IP address and provide results.

## Week 3 - Becoming the adversary
This week we covered the attack life cycle to gain an understanding of adversaries. The demo walked through how to become the adversary and walk through each stage of the attack life cycle.

## Week 4 - Post red team
Last week we simulated being an adversary by stepping through each stage of the attack life cycle with Powershell Empire. This week we will review the steps taken at each stage of our attack from perspective of a defender. The demo this week will touch on the Sysinternals toolkit, how to investigate the Windows event logs.

## Week 5 - OSQuery day
This week is all about OSQuery and how to use it for incident response and threat hunting. The intro to OSQuery was given by some of our own Guardians. Enjoy

## Week 6 - Windows compeititon incident response
This week we reviewed basic controls and mechanisms about Windows. Then we looked at how they can be abused by red team. We reviewed how to make a general five minute plan. Finally, we did a demo on sysinternals.
